# Bounce-ball

This project was done as a part of internship. The ball collision consists of wall collision, where wall is the bounding container and ball collision where each individual 
ball collides with each other and move in different directions according to the varying speed , at different angles, and vector directions. You can update the number of balls 
in container by editing the constant default value of number of balls at the main source code file.
